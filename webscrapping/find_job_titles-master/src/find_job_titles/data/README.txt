People Data Labs Free Title Data
--------------------------------

This is a collection of title relations to skills and other titles.

This is NOT a canonical list of verified or cleaned titles. The collection is centered mostly around direct user-input data (resumes, job app sites, experience history resources) and very little normalization or filtering has been done (note the representation of non-english titles).  We have included the counts of the titles for scale and relativity. The count is roughly equal to the number of person profiles the title occurs on in our dataset.

This is an abridged version of what we use internally, which has ~100k titles each with ~1000 relations for both skills and titles.
