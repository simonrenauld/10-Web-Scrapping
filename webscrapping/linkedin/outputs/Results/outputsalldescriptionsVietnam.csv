What You'll Do

This includes gathering and analyzing information, formulating and testing hypotheses, and developing and communicating recommendations. You’ll also have the opportunity to present results to client management and implement recommendations in collaboration with client team members.

You’ll gain new skills and build on the strengths you bring to the firm. Business Analysts receive exceptional training as well as frequent coaching and mentoring from colleagues on their teams.

As a multidisciplinary team, we strive to deliver insights and recommendations by ways of merging qualitative, quantitative, analytical, and business research.

One of the biggest hurdles our team has had to face in the past is how to optimize the impact of our insights. It took us a lot of collaboration, brainstorming, and experimentation to figure out the best way to tackle this obstacle. Eventually, we learned that having more direct communication on our expectations, packaging and framing our insights that fit with different types of stakeholders, and really listening to what our company needs were the key to overcoming this barrier. Currently, we’re busy at work on various projects, including one about how to optimize our offerings and service for our merchant-partners.
