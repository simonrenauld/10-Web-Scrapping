What You'll Do

You’ll work in teams of typically 3 – 5 consultants, playing an active role in all aspects of the client engagement.

This includes gathering and analyzing information, formulating and testing hypotheses, and developing and communicating recommendations. You’ll also have the opportunity to present results to client management and implement recommendations in collaboration with client team members.

You’ll gain new skills and build on the strengths you bring to the firm. Business Analysts receive exceptional training as well as frequent coaching and mentoring from colleagues on their teams. This support includes a Partner from your local office or practice assigned to you to help guide your career as well as several weeks of formal training in your first two years as a Business Analyst.

Additionally, you’ll receive guidance and support from your local office in the selection of client projects, helping you to develop your skills and build your network.

We view the Business Analyst position as the start of a rewarding, challenging, and highly flexible career with McKinsey. During your first few years with the firm, you will serve as a Business Analyst on multiple client engagements and work with a number of colleagues and clients in a range of industry and functional areas. We encourage you to explore different content areas or geographies through a year-long rotation with one of our practices (e.g., corporate finance, social sector, healthcare, operations) or global offices; many do this after two years as a generalist Business Analyst.

Following your Business Analyst tenure, assuming good performance, you will move into a post-graduate school role. Some Business Analysts will take advantage of the opportunity to get outside experience through a secondment (externship) with a private sector or social sector client with the firm’s support. Others may choose to pursue advanced professional degree with support from the firm.

Who You'll Work With

You will join our Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City office. When you join McKinsey as a Business Analyst, you are joining a firm that will challenge you and invest heavily in your professional development. In this role you will have the opportunity to work on teams and help the best organizations in the world – across the private, public, and social sectors – solve some of their most difficult problems. You will also work with a range of experts in the firm, from data scientists to researchers to software and app designers.

Specifically, our approach combines sharp technical research skills, deep domain expertise on tech products, and well-worn analytical thinking abilities. As a multidisciplinary team, we strive to deliver insights and recommendations by ways of merging qualitative, quantitative, analytical, and business research.

One of the biggest hurdles our team has had to face in the past is how to optimize the impact of our insights. It took us a lot of collaboration, brainstorming, and experimentation to figure out the best way to tackle this obstacle. Eventually, we learned that having more direct communication on our expectations, packaging and framing our insights that fit with different types of stakeholders, and really listening to what our company needs were the key to overcoming this barrier. Currently, we’re busy at work on various projects, including one about how to optimize our offerings and service for our merchant-partners. When we aren’t busy with our heads deep in research, you’d probably find us playing games together through Zoom. We’re made up of cinema enthusiasts, karaoke lovers, and anime fanatics. When COVID eventually subsides, our team is excited to have meals together once again.
